Postman API Test : 
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7506bce24fae3b102df3)


General Questions: 
1 - To me integration test in an API context is for check the API's stability and fonctionalies in the time and after the different modification and/or upgrade.

2 - An API is a set of functions that facilitate, via a programming language, access to the services of an application. She allows applications to communicate with each other and to exchange services or data with each other. I know principaly two types of API webservices : REST and SOAP.

3 - A microservice is an independant composant or procesus, bu working in synergie to make easier the developpment of complex application.

4 - The goal of regression tests is to check if a new software's modification did not generate undesirable side effects, that this (or these) modification did not introduce major regressions in the software.

5 - Jenkins & Travis CI. Personally, I have used and I only knows Jenkins, so I know it is very easy to use and totaly free. About Travis, I know he's easier to use with GitHub, but he's not totally free..
